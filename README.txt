Goals:
1. To appreciate the benefits and challenges of the pipe IPC mechanism.
2. To experiment with POSIX pipes.
3. To use pipe(), read(), and write() system calls in order to implement parent-child
process IPC.
4. Employ the pipe IPC mechanism to solve a real-world problem.
5. To implement a program for computing the hashes of files using multiple hash algorithms.
